# Chapter 1

**How am I feeling right now?**  
5 minutes after switching from my UH computer to my personal computer, I finally got the environment working (after struggling with my work computer for 6 hours)! Feeling slightly annoyed now.

**Impressions from R for health data science & Exercise set 1**  
I'm already slightly familiar with programming and R, so I didn't go through everything in great detail.\
Many of the practical examples and recommendations, such as the one about equivalence & rounding, seem very useful and probably will have saved me from a big headache. On the other hand, I skimmed through the import data section as it had nothing new for me. Everything else will serve as a great reminder.
